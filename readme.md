# Image describer

This add-on gives descriptions of images for you by utilizing Machine Learning methods. Right now the descriptions are quite generic, the thought is to add face detection, emotion recognition, icon classification and OCR to this add-on as well.

Notes:
* The shortcut to get an image description of the current navigator object is NVDA+Control+I.
* If you configure another language than English, the description could have translation issues because it's automatically generated.
* The language of the descriptions that are generated are linked with the configured NVDA language. In other words, if you have Swedish configured, you will get Swedish descriptions, unless you change the language in the Image describer settings.
